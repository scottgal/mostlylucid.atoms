v2.0.0 - BREAKING CHANGES
- BREAKING: Signal lifetime model changed - signals are now owned by atoms/coordinators, NOT by SignalSink
  * SignalSink is now a shared workspace, not the signal lifecycle manager
  * When operations are evicted from coordinator window, their signals are automatically cleared
  * SignalSink's maxAge/maxCapacity are now safety bounds only, not primary expiration mechanism
- BREAKING: Coordinators now call `_options.Signals?.ClearOperation(op.Id)` when finalizing operations
- NEW: Atom-level signal management via AtomBase constructor parameters:
  * `maxSignalCount` - Limit signals this atom can have in sink (0 = unbounded)
  * `maxSignalAge` - Maximum age for this atom's signals (null = unbounded)
- NEW: `CleanupAtomSignals()` protected method in AtomBase for atom-level cleanup
- NEW: `Options` property on CoordinatorBase for public access to configuration
- NEW: `GetSnapshot()` abstract method on CoordinatorBase (implemented by all coordinators)
- IMPROVED: Architecture now enforces single source of truth: atoms own operations AND their signals
- IMPROVED: Better memory management for long-lived atoms (scheduled tasks, etc.)
- TEST: +5 comprehensive tests for coordinator-managed and atom-level signal cleanup
- TEST: All 211+ tests passing with new architecture
- BENCHMARK: New BenchmarkDotNet project for measuring signal cleanup performance
- DOCS: Updated SignalSink-Lifetime.md to clarify new ownership model
- DOCS: Added ASCII diagram showing atom→operation→signal ownership hierarchy

**Migration Guide v1.x → v2.0:**
- If you relied on SignalSink cleaning up signals automatically via maxAge, you now need to:
  1. Use atom-level cleanup parameters (`maxSignalAge`, `maxSignalCount`) for long-lived atoms
  2. Or ensure coordinator window settings (`MaxTrackedOperations`, `MaxOperationLifetime`) match your needs
- SignalSink configuration: maxAge/maxCapacity should now be set conservatively as safety bounds
- Custom coordinators: Must implement `GetSnapshot()` abstract method

v1.8.0
- BREAKING: Major architectural refactoring for SOLID principles
- NEW: CoordinatorBase - consolidated 750+ lines of duplicate coordinator logic into single base class
- NEW: AtomBase<T> - generic base class for atom wrappers, reducing boilerplate by ~20% per atom
- NEW: ConcurrencyHelper - shared concurrency utilities across all coordinators
- NEW: CoordinatorMetrics - thread-safe metrics value type with volatile reads
- IMPROVED: All coordinators now extend CoordinatorBase (EphemeralWorkCoordinator, EphemeralKeyedWorkCoordinator)
- IMPROVED: 6 atoms refactored to use AtomBase (FixedWork, KeyedSequential, Retry, SignalAware, DurableTask, OperationEcho)
- IMPROVED: Updated to C# 12 primary constructors throughout core and atoms
- IMPROVED: Made IConcurrencyGate and OperationEchoStore public for proper encapsulation
- TEST: New test projects for individual atoms (fixedwork, keyedsequential, retry)
- TEST: +21 comprehensive tests for atom behavior
- TEST: All 211 tests passing
- DOCS: Enhanced XML documentation across all core infrastructure
